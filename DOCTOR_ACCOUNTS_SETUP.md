## 🔧 How It Works

### **Database Structure:**

**User Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  email: "sarah.johnson@curaline.com",
  password: "$2a$10$...", // Hashed with bcrypt
  role: "doctor",
  phone: "+63-917-123-4567",
  createdAt: Date
}
```

**Doctor Collection:**
```javascript
{
  _id: ObjectId("..."),
  name: "Dr. Sarah Johnson",
  specialty: "General Practitioner",
  userId: ObjectId("..."), // Links to User
  consultationFee: 500,
  // ... other doctor details
}
```

**Link:** Each doctor profile is linked to their user account via `userId`

## 📊 Appointment Filtering

### **How Doctors See Their Appointments:**

The system filters consultations by matching the doctor's name:

```javascript
// In DoctorDashboard.js
const myConsultations = consultations.filter(c => 
  c.doctorName === user.name || c.doctorId === user.id
);
```

**Example:**
- Dr. Sarah logs in
- System finds consultations where `doctorName === "Dr. Sarah Johnson"`
- Shows only those appointments

---

## 🔐 Security

### **Password Hashing:**
- All passwords hashed with bcrypt (10 rounds)
- Stored as: `$2a$10$xK8.../encrypted...`
- Never stored in plain text

### **Authentication:**
- Email/password login
- Password comparison using bcrypt
- Session-based authentication

### **Authorization:**
- Role-based access control
- Doctors can only see their data
- Patients can only see their data

---

## 📝 Files Modified

1. **server/seed.js**

   - Linked doctor profiles to user accounts
   - Updated console output

2. **TEST_ACCOUNTS.md**
   - Updated with all doctor credentials

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Data Will Be Reset:**
When you run `npm run seed`:
- ❌ All existing users will be deleted
- ❌ All existing consultations will be deleted
- ❌ All existing appointments will be lost
- ✅ Fresh doctor accounts will be created
- ✅ Test patient account will be created

### **Your Existing Appointment:**
Since you mentioned you already made an appointment with a new patient, that data will be lost when you re-seed. You'll need to:
1. Re-seed the database
2. Register the patient again (or use test patient)
3. Book the appointment again

**OR** if you want to keep existing data:
- Don't run `npm run seed`
- Manually create doctor accounts via registration
- Link them to existing doctor profiles
