# üìß Email Service & üé• WebRTC Video Calling Setup Guide

## Overview

This guide will help you set up:
1. **Real Email Service** using Nodemailer (Gmail, SendGrid, or custom SMTP)
2. **WebRTC Video Calling** using Socket.io for signaling

---

## üì¶ Step 1: Install Dependencies

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
npm install nodemailer socket.io
```

### Frontend Dependencies
```bash
cd client
npm install socket.io-client
cd ..
```

---

## üìß Step 2: Configure Email Service

### Option A: Gmail (Easiest for Testing)

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - Select "Mail" and "Other (Custom name)"
   - Name it "CuraLine" and click "Generate"
   - Copy the 16-character password

3. **Update `.env` file:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-16-char-app-password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=CuraLine Health
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Option B: SendGrid (Recommended for Production)

1. **Sign up** at https://sendgrid.com (Free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. **Create API Key:**
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí API Keys
   - Create API Key with "Full Access"
   - Copy the API key

3. **Update `.env` file:**
```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid
EMAIL_USER=your-email@example.com
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your-sendgrid-api-key
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=CuraLine Health
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Option C: Custom SMTP

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp
SMTP_HOST=smtp.example.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_SECURE=false
SMTP_USER=your-smtp-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=CuraLine Health
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Testing Email Service

The email service will automatically:
- Send booking confirmations
- Send password reset emails
- Send prescription notifications
- Send appointment reminders

If email credentials are not configured, it will **fallback to console logging** (simulation mode).

---

## üé• Step 3: Configure WebRTC Video Calling

### What's Included

The WebRTC implementation includes:
- ‚úÖ Real-time video and audio
- ‚úÖ Camera on/off toggle
- ‚úÖ Microphone mute/unmute
- ‚úÖ Screen sharing
- ‚úÖ Text chat during call
- ‚úÖ Socket.io signaling server
- ‚úÖ STUN servers for NAT traversal

### Update App.js to Use WebRTC Component

**Option 1: Replace the existing ConsultationRoom**

Edit `client/src/App.js`:

```javascript
// Change this import
import ConsultationRoom from './pages/ConsultationRoom';

// To this
import ConsultationRoom from './pages/ConsultationRoomWebRTC';
```

**Option 2: Keep both versions**

You can keep both and switch between them as needed.

### Environment Variables (Optional)

Add to `client/.env` (create if doesn't exist):

```env
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

For production, change to your server URL:
```env
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://your-domain.com
```

---

## üöÄ Step 4: Start the Application

### Terminal 1: Start Backend
```bash
npm run server
```

You should see:
```
‚úÖ MongoDB Connected
‚úÖ Email service initialized
‚úÖ Socket.io server initialized for WebRTC signaling
üöÄ Server is running on port 5000
üîå Socket.io server ready for WebRTC signaling
```

### Terminal 2: Start Frontend
```bash
npm run client
```

Or run both together:
```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## üß™ Step 5: Test the Features

### Testing Email Service

1. **Register a new account** or use existing account
2. **Book a consultation** ‚Üí Check for confirmation email
3. **Use Forgot Password** ‚Üí Check for reset email
4. **Doctor issues prescription** ‚Üí Check for prescription email

**Check Console:** If emails aren't configured, they'll appear in the server console.

### Testing Video Calling

1. **Book a consultation** as a patient
2. **Click "Join Video Call"** from My Consultations
3. **Open another browser** (or incognito window)
4. **Login as the doctor** for that consultation
5. **Click "Join Video Call"** from Doctor Dashboard

**What to expect:**
- Both users should see each other's video
- Camera/mic controls should work
- Screen sharing should work
- Chat messages should appear in real-time

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Email Issues

**Problem:** Emails not sending

**Solutions:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct credentials
2. For Gmail: Ensure App Password is used (not regular password)
3. Check server console for error messages
4. Verify EMAIL_PROVIDER is set correctly

**Problem:** Gmail "Less secure app" error

**Solution:** Use App Password instead of regular password (see Gmail setup above)

### WebRTC Issues

**Problem:** "Cannot access camera/microphone"

**Solutions:**
1. Grant browser permission for camera/microphone
2. Use HTTPS in production (required for WebRTC)
3. Check if another app is using the camera

**Problem:** Video not connecting

**Solutions:**
1. Check if Socket.io server is running (see server console)
2. Ensure both users are in the same consultation room
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Try refreshing the page

**Problem:** Connection fails behind firewall/NAT

**Solutions:**
1. STUN servers are already configured (Google's public STUN)
2. For production, consider adding TURN servers:

```javascript
// In ConsultationRoomWebRTC.js, update ICE_SERVERS:
const ICE_SERVERS = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    {
      urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
      username: 'username',
      credential: 'password'
    }
  ]
};
```

## üìä Features Comparison

### Before (Simulated)
- ‚ùå Emails logged to console only
- ‚ùå Video UI only (no real connection)
- ‚ùå No peer-to-peer communication

### After (Real Implementation)
- ‚úÖ Real emails sent via Gmail/SendGrid/SMTP
- ‚úÖ Real WebRTC video/audio connection
- ‚úÖ Peer-to-peer communication
- ‚úÖ Screen sharing capability
- ‚úÖ Real-time chat with Socket.io

---

## üîí Security Considerations

### Email Security
- ‚úÖ Use App Passwords (Gmail) or API Keys (SendGrid)
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env` file to version control
- ‚úÖ Use environment variables for credentials
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production: Use dedicated email service (SendGrid, Mailgun)

### WebRTC Security
- ‚úÖ HTTPS required for production (WebRTC requirement)
- ‚úÖ Validate user permissions before joining rooms
- ‚úÖ Implement room authentication
- ‚ö†Ô∏è For production: Add TURN servers for better connectivity

---

## üåê Production Deployment

### Email Service
1. Use SendGrid or Mailgun (more reliable than Gmail)
2. Set up domain authentication (SPF, DKIM)
3. Monitor email delivery rates
4. Implement email templates with your branding

### WebRTC Service
1. Deploy with HTTPS (required for camera/microphone access)
2. Set up TURN servers (for users behind strict firewalls)
3. Consider using services like:
   - Twilio Video
   - Agora.io
   - Daily.co
   - Or self-hosted Jitsi

### Environment Variables
```env
# Production .env
