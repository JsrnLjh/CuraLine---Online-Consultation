## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
2. **MongoDB** (installed and running)
3. **npm** (comes with Node.js)

### Step-by-Step Installation

#### 1. Start MongoDB
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# Mac
brew services start mongodb-community

# Linux
sudo systemctl start mongodb
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Client dependencies
cd client
npm install
cd ..
```

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/curaline

# Email Configuration (Optional)
EMAIL_PROVIDER=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
EMAIL_FROM_NAME=CuraLine Health
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

#### 4. Seed Database
```bash
npm run seed
```
This creates:
- Admin account
- 4 doctor accounts
- 1 patient account
- Sample doctor profiles

#### 5. Start Application
```bash
npm run dev
```
This starts:
- Backend server on `http://localhost:5000`
- Frontend React app on `http://localhost:3000`

### Email Configuration (Optional)

For real email notifications, set up Gmail App Password:

1. Enable 2-Step Verification on Gmail
2. Generate App Password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Update `.env` with your credentials
4. Restart server

**Without email config:** System works in simulation mode (emails logged to console)

2. TURN servers for WebRTC (better connectivity)
3. Export reports to PDF/Excel
4. Email report scheduling
5. SMS reminders (Twilio)

1. Doctor reviews and ratings
2. Medical records upload
3. Lab results integration
4. Advanced data visualization (Chart.js)
5. Push notifications (Firebase)

#### Long-term (Future releases)
1. Mobile app (React Native)
2. Insurance claims processing
3. Multi-language support
4. Telemedicine AI assistant
5. Prescription e-pharmacy integration
6. Wearable device integration

### Production Checklist
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas (cloud database)
- [ ] Configure real email service
- [ ] Integrate payment gateway
- [ ] Add TURN servers for WebRTC
- [ ] Set up SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add input sanitization
