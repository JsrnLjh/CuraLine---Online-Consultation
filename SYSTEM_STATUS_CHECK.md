## ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES & CONSIDERATIONS

### 1. **MongoDB Service** (Action Required)
- ⚠️ MongoDB must be installed and running locally
- ⚠️ Connection string: `mongodb://localhost:27017/curaline`
- **Action:** Ensure MongoDB service is started before running the app
- **Command:** `net start MongoDB` (Windows) or start MongoDB service

### 2. **Dependencies Installation**
- ⚠️ Root dependencies appear installed
- ⚠️ Client dependencies installed
- **Action:** Run `npm install` in root if needed
- **Action:** Run `cd client && npm install` if needed

### 3. **Email Notifications** (Simulated)
- ⚠️ Currently using console.log for email simulation
- **Future:** Integrate real email service (SendGrid, Mailgun, etc.)
- **Impact:** Low - system fully functional without real emails

### 4. **WebRTC Signaling** (Placeholder)
- ⚠️ Video call UI is complete but needs WebRTC signaling server
- **Future:** Implement Socket.io or WebRTC signaling service
- **Impact:** Medium - video calls won't connect without signaling

### 5. **Payment Gateway** (Simulated)
- ⚠️ Payment processing is simulated (no real transactions)
- **Future:** Integrate Stripe, PayMongo, or similar
- **Impact:** Low - payment flow is complete, just needs real gateway

## 🚀 HOW TO RUN THE SYSTEM

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js** (v14 or higher) - ✅ Assumed installed
2. **MongoDB** - ⚠️ Must be installed and running
3. **npm** - ✅ Assumed installed

### Step-by-Step

#### 1. Start MongoDB
```bash
# Windows
net start MongoDB

# Or if MongoDB is not a service
mongod
```

#### 2. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
# Root dependencies
npm install

# Client dependencies
cd client
npm install
